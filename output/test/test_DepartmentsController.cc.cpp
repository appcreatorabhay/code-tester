**Notes:**

* These tests assume that the `DepartmentsController` class has the necessary methods and attributes to perform the intended functionality.
* The `request` object is not included in the test cases, as it is not relevant to the test purpose.
* The `Json` library is used to convert the JSON data into `Department` objects.
