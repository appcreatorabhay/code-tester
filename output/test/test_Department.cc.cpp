This code defines a C++ model called `Department`. It contains various methods for validating and updating a `Department` object from a JSON object. It also defines methods for getting all persons from a department and for getting a `Department` object by its primary key.

**Notes:**

* Each method takes a `DbClientPtr` and an `ExceptionCallback` as parameters.
* `validJsonOfField()` checks the type and format of the value in the `pJson` object.
* `getPersons()` uses a `DbClientPtr` and a callback function to execute a SQL query and return all matching `Person` objects.
* The `Department` model uses `std::string` for primary key, `int` for secondary key and `std::string` for other fields.
